**Walmart-USA-Advanced-Software-Engineering Project**

**Overview**

This project encompasses various aspects of advanced software engineering and data management, focusing on the implementation of a novel version of a heap, software architecture design, relational database design, and data munging. These tasks were undertaken as part of my journey to enhance practical skills in Java, data structures, software architecture, SQL, and Python.

**Project Tasks**

**1. Advanced Data Structures - Novel Heap Implementation**

In this task, I undertook the challenge of implementing a novel version of a heap data structure. Heap data structures are fundamental in computer science and find applications in various domains such as priority queues, scheduling algorithms, and graph algorithms. By working on this task, I gained practical experience in Java programming, data structures, and optimization techniques.

**Skills Gained:**
- Java Programming
- Data Structures
- Optimization Techniques

**2. Software Architecture - Complex Business Requirements**

For this task, I focused on designing a software system that satisfies complex business requirements. Effective software architecture is crucial for building scalable, maintainable, and efficient systems. This task involved creating a robust architecture using Java and UML to model the system's components and interactions.

**Skills Gained:**
- Java Programming
- Software Architecture Design
- UML Modeling

**3. Relational Database Design - Complex Requirements**

In this task, I tackled the design of a relational database to meet a complex set of requirements. Relational databases are a cornerstone of data management in modern applications. This project included designing the database schema, relationships, and queries using SQL.

**Skills Gained:**
- SQL
- Relational Database Design

**4. Data Munging - Data Transformation and Population**

Data munging involved the process of transforming and populating a database with a large quantity of data in disparate formats. I utilized Python and SQL to extract, clean, and load data into the database efficiently. Data munging is a critical skill in data engineering and analytics.

**Skills Gained:**
- Python Programming
- SQL Data Manipulation
- Data Extraction and Transformation
